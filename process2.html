    <h2>Poster Project</h2>
    <p>This is an individual project for IAT102, a course that teaches the basics of
      graphic design. The premise was to create an advertising exhibition poster for
      an artist or designer.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="process-container">
      <div class="process-block">
        <h3>Thought Process</h3>
        <p>I chose to design a poster for Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola, who incorporates
          the style of minimalism in a playful matter, which suits my interest in creating simple
          designs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-block">
          <img src="https://cdn.stylepark.com/articles/Patricia-Urquiola-c-Roger-Decker.jpg?mtime=20190312110022&focal=none" width="300px" height="400px" alt="A portrait of Spanish Designer Patricia Urquiola">
        </div>

        <p>I started off by sketching different layouts of the poster. The shapes of the placement
          pictures were sketched in a way for the viewer to not see the full picture, making the
          viewer curious to see more of the design by going to the exhibit.</p>

          <div class="process-block">
            <div class="large-image-block">
              <img src="img/Poster-Sketches.jpg" width="400px" height="600px" alt="20 draft sketches of the poster project">
            </div>
          </div>

        </div>

        <div class="process-container">
          <h3>Draft Posters</h3>
          <p>I then chose two sketches that I liked the most and worked on two drafts in Adobe InDesign.
            The first design was based on Urquiola’s design of shimmering glass products. The second
            design was based on her product of large ceramics. I mostly played with the typography for
            both drafts, as I wanted the words to stand out.</p>

            <div class="poster-block">
              <img src="img/Poster-Draft1.jpg" width="400px" height="600px" alt="The first poster draft">
            </div>

            <div class="poster-block">
              <img src="img/Poster-Draft2.jpg" width="400px" height="600px" alt="The second poster draft">
            </div>

          </div>

          <div class="process-container">
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>When I got feedback from my drafts, both posters had issues with the colour palette; the
              first draft was too bright, making it hard to see, while the second draft was too dull,
              which makes it look unappealing. My final poster was based on the second draft, but I had
              trouble changing the colour palette since those products have dark tones. Thus, I decided
              to start fresh and find another product of Urquiola’s with an appealing colour scheme to work
              with.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="process-container">
              <h3>Reflection</h3>
              <p>My final design was praised for the asymmetry, typography, and colour choice. The only issue
                was the overuse of bars which are used for highlighting only one piece of information. Overall,
                I learned that feedback and critiques are important for designers and that it is okay to restart
                a project if one of your drafts doesn’t meet expectations.</p>
