        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>I am an undergrad student from the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University with a concentration in Design. My design style consists of using bold typography and colours to create eye-catching visuals. Along with my experience creating bold and clean graphics, I am also a self-taught artist with a strong interest in creating illustrations and concept art. I seek to create these designs and illustrations that are simple, yet striking with graphic softwares such as Adobe and Autodesk.</p>

      <section class="element">
        <h3>Graphic Short Story</h3>

          <p>This is an individual project for IAT100, a course that teaches the basics of
             visual design and animation. The premise was to create a comic based on a poem
             or a piece of literature.</p>

          <p>I choose the poem “A Boat Beneath a Sunny Sky” by Lewis Carroll. It recounts
             how Carroll would spend time with Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Alice in
             Wonderland, on a boat ride and still reminisce these moments even when summer
             is over. Thus, my take on the poem is about a father and a daughter, with the
             twist being that the daughter drowned and the father is grieving over her death.</p>

          <p>I sketched out the main characters to get a clear vision of what they will look like,
             as well as some small panel layouts and scenes that I might use for the comic.</p>

          <p>After, I scanned my sketches to my computer and created a rough page layout with the
             image editor GIMP. Then, I moved over to Autodesk Sketchbook to draw the outlines of
             my scenes and panels.</p>

         <p>By the time I finished the outlines, the deadline of the project was approaching. Due
            to the page size (8.3” x 11.7”), outlining the panels and drawings took too much of my
            time. Thus, I decided to colour the comic in black and white, only colouring in what is
            important; it also fits the sad twist of the story.</p>

          <p>When I presented my comic, I was complimented by how well drawn it is and that the
             transitions between panels were easy to follow. Overall, I learned how much work it
             takes to draw a comic but I enjoyed the final result I had in the end. Even though I
             wasn’t able to fully colour the scenes, I felt the monochrome tones really suited the
             story. </p>

          <h3>Poster Project</h3>

            <p>This is an individual project for IAT102, a course that teaches the basics of
               graphic design. The premise was to create an advertising exhibition poster for
               an artist or designer.</p>

            <p>I chose to design a poster for Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola, who incorporates
               the style of minimalism in a playful matter, which suits my interest in creating simple
               designs.</p>

            <p>I started off by sketching different layouts of the poster, using the style of geometry
               and symmetry as my starting points. The shapes of the placement pictures were sketched
               in a way for the viewer to not see the full picture, making the viewer curious to see
               more of the design by going to the exhibit.</p>

            <p>After, I chose two sketches that I liked the most and worked on two different drafts in Adobe InDesign. The first design was based on Urquiola’s design of shimmering glass products. The second design was based on her design of large ceramics. I mostly played with the typography for both drafts, as I wanted the bold words to stand out.</p>

            <p>The feedback I received from these drafts was that the first draft’s colour scheme is too bright and the layout was too symmetrical while the second draft’s typography was great, but the colour scheme was too dull. Using that feedback, I designed my final poster to be based on the second, but I decided to work with another design by Urquiola’s so I can work on another colour palette.</p>

            <p>My final design was drastically different from my draft posters and was praised for the asymmetry, typography, and choice of colours. The only issue was the overuse of bars which are used for highlighting only one important piece of information.</p>
